# PS/2 Keyboard Reader

PS2KeyboardReader allows you to read PS2 Keybard state info 

Cloned and modified version of the PS2Keyboard library by Paul Stoffregen:
https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/PS2Keyboard

^original library is more suitable for using PS2 keyboards as standard keyboards. This
library was made specifically for use in audio projects where multiple keys are pressed at once, 
and timing of key up/down events is important.

TLDR: 
 - Lets you see the state of all keys on keyboard in real time.
 - Installed within arduino packages at: 
  - /home/{USERNAME}/.arduino15/packages/teensy/hardware/avr/1.58.1/libraries/PS2KeyboardReader
 - Imported as:
